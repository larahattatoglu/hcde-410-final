Abstract

Many critics of the pro-life movement highlight the irony of protecting a fetus's life up until birth and then providing minimal support and protection after birth. This study focuses on states that restrict access to or ban abortion and their ability to provide care to children and families post-partum. One measure that determines a childâ€™s quality of life is poverty. Therefore, the research question surrounding this study was whether child poverty rates are higher in states with strict abortion laws. Twenty two states were selected based on whether they have the following abortion restrictive laws in place: pre-roe ban, trigger ban, near-total ban, 6-week ban, 8-week ban, and State Constitution Bars Protection. The average child poverty index in 2019 for these states were compared to the remainder of the states. A t-test was conducted to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference between these two datasets. The results showed that there was a signficiant difference, with states that are strict on abortion having a higher incidence of child poverty.
